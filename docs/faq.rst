General
=======

Who needs this program?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several bibliography programs out there (e.g. JabRef/Citavi) that can manage .bib files.
But this program was designed to apply specific changes to a large amount of entries in huge bibliography files (>20k lines).
This tool is meant for fast and complex changes at large scale.

Will there be a UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is planned but there is no release date yet.

Is this program free?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes

Does this program corrupt my bibliography integrity?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This program has been tested on numerous huge bibliography files (100k+ lines) without problems.
But this program is still under heavy development so I highly recommend creating a backup of your bibliography before using this tool.
